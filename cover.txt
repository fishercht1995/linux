mm: memcg kselftests fixes

I'm resending two memcg kselftests fixes, which I first posted in 2019 [1],
however they didn't go anywhere. I've rechecked them and they're are both
still actual, even though there were new regressions introduced since that,
so not all tests are passing now. I know that David Vernet (cc'ed) is working
on fixing (some of) them, so hopefully he'll post more fixes soon.

I believe it's better for such patches to go through mm and cgroup trees
(and mailing lists), where there are better chances for them to be properly
reviewed, so adding corresponding entries to the MAINTAINERS file to make it
obvious.
